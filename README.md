# CHOMSKY-CLASSIFICATION
C program to classify the type of grammar using CHOMSKY CLASSIFICATION.

Most famous classification of grammars and languages introduced by Noam Chomsky is divided into four classes:

1. Recursively enumerable grammars –recognizable by a Turing machine.
2. Context-sensitive grammars –recognizable by the linear bounded automaton.
3. Context-free grammars - recognizable by the pushdown automaton.
4. Regular grammars –recognizable by the finite state automaton.
